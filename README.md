# Yelp-Academic-Dataset-Analysis
This project focuses on exploring how different database systems handle semi-structured JSON data, with a special emphasis on MongoDB, which stores data in documents. The project will use the Yelp Academic Dataset, which includes information on businesses, reviews, and users. While reviews and users are limited to 7500 reviews and 1000 users due to the constraints of JupyterHub and Mongo instances, the full businesses dataset will be utilized.

Throughout the project, the aim is to gain an understanding of MongoDB's capabilities as a NoSQL datastore for documents and to compare and contrast its data representation format with the relational model. This investigation will provide insights into what Mongo can and cannot do with regards to its documents, helping to identify potential use cases and limitations for this type of database system.
